# JavaScript Function with Potential Null Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to null value handling in functions. The `foo` function aims to add two numbers; however, it only explicitly checks for `null` values. This can lead to unexpected behavior if other falsy values like `undefined` or `0` are passed as arguments.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function correctly handles `null` inputs by returning 0.  However, it doesn't consider `undefined`, which would result in `NaN` if the addition is attempted.  It also doesn't consider the case where either `a` or `b` is 0, which might be treated as an error in certain contexts. A more robust solution would handle these edge cases more gracefully.

## Solution

The solution addresses these shortcomings by providing a more comprehensive check using a strict equality check against `null` and `undefined` and handling those cases correctly.
